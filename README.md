# An Analysis of Green Energy Stocks

## Overview of Project

### Purpose

This analysis is to help Steve, a recent graduate with a finance degree. His parents are passionate about green energy and have decided to invest all their money into DAQO New Energy Corp ($DQ) without doing much research. Steve has promised to look into DAQO stock for his parents but is concerned about diversifying their funds, so he wants to analyze a handful of green energy stocks in addition to DAQO's stock.

Steve has created an excel file containing the stock data and has asked us to help him analyze it. By using Excel and VBA, we automate the analysis using code and built in macros to run scripts that finds the total daily volume and yearly return for each stock.  

Louise, who wants to start a crowdfunding campaign to help fund her play - Fever. She's estimating a budget of over $10,000. By using Excel, we analyze crowdfunding data to determine whether there are specific factors to make a project's campaign successful. We take a look at the crowdfunding outcomes based on launch dates as well as the outcomes based on the fundraising goals set for the campaigns. These insights are used to help Louise gain a greater understanding of past crowdfunding campaigns so that she can mirror other succcessful campaigns in her category.

## Results

### Conclusions made about the Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

- Campaigns launched in May had the highest number of successful campaigns
- Campaigns launched in December had the lowest number of successful campaigns

### Conclusions made about the Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

- Fundraising goals of less than $5,000 had the highest success rates
- We could also conclude that other factors other than fundraising goals play a part in a successful campaign as we saw goals set between $35,000 and $44,999 also having high success rates

### Summary

There are some limitations to this dataset that include:

- Data limited to only 2010-2017, fresher data could help with more recent years
- Lack of data about the form of marketing and promotion used in executing the campaign fundraising (i.e. email marketing, social media, etc.)

Another graph we could create could be another line graph of Theater Outcomes by Launch Date using percentages. As noted in the Analysis of Outcomes by Launch Date, the most successful campaigns launched in May. However, May also had the most failed campaigns by quantity. If we used percentages, we would see that May had the highest percentage of successful campaigns (67%) followed by June (65%), and December had the highest percentage failed (47%) followed by October (43%). To enhance this chart even further we could filter on goals with about $10,000 since Louise is budgeting over $10,000 for her campaign.
